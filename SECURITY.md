## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

To report a vulnerability, please use [GitHub's private security advisory](https://github.com/sup3rus3r/obsidian-ai/security/advisories/new). This ensures your report remains confidential until a fix is available.

Include as much of the following as possible:

- A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact
- The component or area affected (e.g., authentication, encryption, API, RAG)
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Any proof-of-concept code or screenshots
- Suggested mitigations, if any

You will receive a response as quickly as possible. Please allow reasonable time to investigate and patch the issue before any public disclosure.
